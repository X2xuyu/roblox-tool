# 🔫 Roblox Username Finder

**A lightweight Windows tool to search for short and available Roblox usernames.**  
No login, no Python — just a fast, simple desktop app for username hunters.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Finder Fast (Random Mode)**  
  Quickly checks random usernames with optional digits anywhere in the name.  
  → Fastest way to find something available.

- **Finder (Ordered Mode)**  
  Sequentially scans usernames by length.  
  → Good for targeted, predictable name patterns.

- **Get CSRF Token Utility**  
  Instantly fetches a valid **X-CSRF-TOKEN** from Roblox API —  
  useful when testing requests or debugging 403 issues.

All username checks use Roblox’s official validation endpoint:  
`https://auth.roblox.com/v1/usernames/validate`

## ⚙️ Quick Start

1. Open the app.  
2. Select **Finder Fast** *(recommended)*.  
3. Set your target name lengths (e.g., `4, 5`).  
4. Set **Required digits** to `1–2`.  
5. Click **Start** — a popup will appear if an available name is found.

💡 Tip:  
Roblox usernames must be **3+ characters**,  
but 3-letter names are almost always taken.  
Try **4–5** characters with **1–2 digits** for best results.

## 🧩 Troubleshooting

**🕒 Nothing happens when opening:**  
Antivirus or SmartScreen may block it. Right-click → “Run anyway”.

**🚫 Too Many Requests (429):**  
You’re hitting the rate limit. Increase delay/backoff in settings.

**❌ 403 Forbidden:**  
Click **Get CSRF Token** first, then retry.
