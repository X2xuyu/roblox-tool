# Roblox Username 🔫

**A tiny Windows app that helps you find short, available Roblox usernames.**
It has two search modes and a button to quickly grab a CSRF token for testing.

# Download & Run

Go to the Releases on this repo and download RBX-Username-Suite.exe.

Double-click to open. No install, no Python needed.

If Windows SmartScreen shows up, click More info → Run anyway (it’s just an unsigned indie app).

Works on Windows 10/11 (64-bit). Needs internet.

What it can do

Finder Fast (random) – Tries lots of random names (digits can be anywhere). Usually the quickest way to find something free.

Finder (ordered) – Tries names in order, starting from the shortest length.

Get CSRF Token – Just a quick test to fetch an X-CSRF-TOKEN from Roblox (handy if you’re seeing 403s).

All checks go to the official endpoint:
https://auth.roblox.com/v1/usernames/validate

Quick guide

Open the app.

Pick Finder Fast (recommended):

Set target lengths, e.g. 4,5.

Set Required digits to 1-2 (digits anywhere tends to be freer).

Press Start and wait. A popup will show if a name is free.
If Fast doesn’t find one, try Finder (ordered) with a couple of lengths.

Tip: Roblox allows 3+ characters, but 3 is almost always taken. Try 4–5 with 1–2 digits.
Troubleshooting

Nothing happens when I open it
Your antivirus/SmartScreen might be blocking it. Allow it, or right-click → Run anyway.

Keeps saying “Too Many Requests (429)”
Increase the delay/backoff in the settings and try again later.

403 issues
Open Get CSRF Token first, then try again.

Privacy / Notes

No login needed. The app only checks username availability.

It doesn’t save or upload your data.
